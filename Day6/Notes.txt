JWT tokenss for Auth:
 - JWT -> JSON Web Token
 - a stateless Token based validation method, which stores token in client side only.
 - it is generate in server side but
 - it is stored in client side(eg: Local Storage) when user sends valid credentials, and then it is send to the Backend in each API call
 - the token is send to the server side in the Header section
 
 - JWT Token Structure:
	1. Header: contains the metadata about the token
		eg: {
			"alg": "HS256",
			"typ": "JWT"
			}
	2. Payload: include actual data(claims) of the token.
	   > Not an Encrypted form, Eg:
			{
			"sub": "1234567890",
			"name": "John Doe",
			"iat": 1516239022
			}
	   > this can include non sensitive info such as user Id, Name, Role, etc. but not Password.
	3. Signature: ensures the integrity of the token
	   > to generate signature, the API encodes the header and payload with a secret key(know only yo the API) using a hashing algorithm
	   
Storing Hashed Passwords:
 - Never store plain passwords
 - Always store hashed passwords
 
 Hashing: 
	- One-way encryption
	- cannot be reversed
	- Even admins can't see passwords
	- Tool used: bcrypt
